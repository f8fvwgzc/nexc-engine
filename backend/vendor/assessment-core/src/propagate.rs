//! Impact propagation: how far, and how strongly, one field change reaches
//! through the graph.
//!
//! Each scored field of each changed entity is a *seed* carrying a risk
//! (severity × magnitude) and a strength per channel. From the seed, impact
//! travels breadth-first:
//!
//! * **down** to children and further descendants, **up** to the parent and
//!   further ancestors, **dependency** to what the entity blocks (and their
//!   children), **upstream** to its blockers; **related** and **sibling** one hop only;
//! * losing `hop_decay` per hop beyond the first, stopping at `max_depth` or
//!   where even the strongest possible contribution falls below
//!   `min_impact`, keeping the strongest path per (entity, channel), within
//!   the seed's own step budget (so one change cannot starve another, and
//!   the result does not depend on the order of the changes);
//! * scaled at each target by a **relevance** that depends on the field:
//!   how much of the added or removed text the target's own text and title
//!   share (TF-IDF cosine, and the embedding change direction when
//!   available) — the child that best matches a removed passage *owns* it —,
//!   what share of the parent's effort an estimate change (or a creation,
//!   deletion, cancellation) moves, whether a moved date now conflicts with
//!   the target's (newly or worse than before), whether a canceled parent
//!   leaves the target active, whether a reassignment hits a sibling with
//!   the same assignee.
//!
//! A contribution is `severity × m_eff × transfer × relevance`, where `m_eff`
//! is the seed's magnitude except when the target redefines it (an estimate
//! change measured against the parent's effort, a removed passage the target
//! owns). Contributions below `min_impact` are dropped (a noise gate: a
//! relevance floor is not evidence), except effort moves, which the engine
//! sums per target before measuring their share, so fifty small
//! re-estimates weigh what one large one would.
